# phaserTemplate

This template provides everything needed to create a new Phaser project that uses a server from node. <br>
Make sure you have node.js downloaded to your computer.<br>
Then simply clone the code to your computer. Then navigate to the file directory and run in the command prompt: <br>
npm i<br>
And begin coding in the game.js file. <br>
When you want to test your app, simply run in the command prompt:<br>
npm run dev<br>
This will open a tab and will live reload the program as you make changes.
