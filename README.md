# phaserTemplate

This template provides everything needed to create a new Phaser project that uses a server from node. 
Make sure you have node.js downloaded to your computer.
Then simply clone the code to your computer. Then navigate to the file directory and run in the command prompt: <br>
npm i<br>
And begin coding in the game.js file. 
When you want to test your app, simply run in the command prompt:
npm run dev
This will open a tab and will live reload the program as you make changes.
